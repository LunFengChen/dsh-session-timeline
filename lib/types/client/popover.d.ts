/**
 * The rewind mode-selection popover (plain DOM, no React). Step two of the
 * interaction: the target is already fixed (the clicked message); the popover
 * offers the two modes. Choosing "both" first fetches the impact list through
 * the `/rewind preview @seq both` command and shows it before confirming.
 *
 * Keyboard: ↑/↓ move focus across the step's ACTION buttons only (the two
 * modes, or the confirm button on the impact step), Enter activates the
 * focused button (native), Esc is the keyboard twin of the ghost back/cancel
 * buttons — cancel on the modes step, back on the impact step; the ghosts are
 * never in the arrow cycle. The listener runs in the document capture phase
 * so the keys are stolen from the composer while the popover is open.
