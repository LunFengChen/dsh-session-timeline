/**
 * dsh-session-timeline client half: the `/rewind` command decoration, the locale
 * registration, and the session-scoped portal bridge that renders the
 * per-message ↶ rewind button (see
 * `portals.tsx` for the button itself).
 *
 * The button is NOT injected by hand into the DOM anymore: the plugin
 * registers a bridge into the harness's `conversation.session.header.actions`
 * list slot, and that bridge portals a React button into every user message's
 * IconActions row — the same rendering family as the copy button (a React
 * child of the actions row), without touching any harness source. The
 * registration is typed structurally (see `SlotsLike` in portals.tsx), so the
 * plugin never imports conversation UI types and survives harness version
 * drift.
 *
 * The text-driven flow is the harness's STANDARD command decoration
 * (`ctx.commandUi.decorate`): a bare `/rewind` (or its alias `/undo`) —
 * picked from the slash-menu completion, or typed in full and Entered —
 * opens the harness's own popupSelect shell (search, ↑↓/Enter, Esc) listing
 * the rewind candidates instead of executing the command. Picking one
 * continues the SAME flow as the ↶ button: the mode popover, both-impact
 * confirmation, execution, row hiding and the composer refill
 * (`runRewindAndFill`). File restore uses `/rewind __restore`; impact preview
 * uses `/rewind preview`. Conversation truncation uses `deleteFrom` so a
 * slash-command handler never cuts `command/run` out from under `command/done`.
 *
